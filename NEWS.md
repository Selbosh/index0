# index 0.0.2

* Added a `c()` method, so now if you combine zero-indexed vectors they remain
zero-indexed.
* Added a `str()` method, so zero-indexed objects don't look so strange when viewed in the RStudio Environment pane.

# index0 0.0.1

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
